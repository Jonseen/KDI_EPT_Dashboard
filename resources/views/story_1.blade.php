        <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, on Friday, vacated the tribunal 
          judgement that nullified the election of Governor Ademola Adeleke of Osun State.</p>
          <p>
          The appellate court, in a unanimous decision by a three-member panel of Justices, 
          held that the appeal Adeleke lodged to challenge his sack by the Osun State 
          Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, was meritorious.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Aside from setting aside the judgement of the tribunal, the court, 
          in its lead judgement that was delivered by Justice Mohammed Lawal, 
          awarded N500, 000 cost against the All Progressive Congress, APC, and its candidate, Gboyega Oyetola
